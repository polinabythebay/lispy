c notes

C program

only function definitions and structure defs

source file: list of functions and types
	you can call funs in other libraries/use other library data types

explicit typing

structs used to declare new types

typedef struct {
	
	float x;
	float y;
}

point p;

p.x = 0.1;
p.y = 10.0;

Pointers

pointer to an integer: int*

pointer to pointers to a characters: char**

Strings are represented by pointer type: char*
	they are stored as list of chars
	final char is null terminator


Inside conditional statement's parenthesis any value that is not 0 is evaluated to true.

A problem with C: portability
hard to have my source code compile no matter where 
mechanism: preprocessor
	detects which operating system code is being compiled on

anything with # is a preprocessor command; happens before the code is compiled
